# Introduction:

In manual testing, having well-defined test cases, detailed scenarios, and insightful reports is essential. This repository aims to provide a centralized place for organizing and documenting these elements, making manual testing projects more efficient and effective. By keeping everything in one location, it simplifies the process, prevents duplication, and promotes better collaboration among team members.

# Test Cases

The test-cases directory contains a collection of test cases written for different features or modules of the system under test. Each test case should include the following information:
Test case ID
Test case description
Test case Data
Steps to Reproduce
Actual Results (to be filled during test execution)
Expected results
Pass/Fail
Test cases are essential for ensuring thorough test coverage and providing a clear roadmap for manual testing.

 # Scenarios
 
Scenarios in manual testing are detailed representations of various user workflows or use cases within the system. They help testers understand how the system behaves from the end-users' perspective and ensure thorough testing of all user interactions.
