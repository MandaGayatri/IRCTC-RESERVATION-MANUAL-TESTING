# Introduction:
In manual testing, it is crucial to have well-defined test cases, detailed scenarios and insightful reports. This repository aims to provide a centralized location for organizing and documenting these artifacts to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of manual testing projects. 
# Test Cases
The test-cases directory contains a collection of test cases written for different features or modules of the system under test. Each test case should include the following information:
Test case ID
Test case description
Test case Data
Steps to Reproduce
Actual Results (to be filled during test execution)
Expected results
Test cases are essential for ensuring thorough test coverage and providing a clear roadmap for manual testing.
 # Scenarios
 The scenarios consists of detailed scenarios that represent different user workflows or use cases within the system. Scenarios help testers understand the system's behavior from end-users' perspectives and ensure that all user interactions are thoroughly tested.
# Reports
The reports are dedicated to storing various reports generated during manual testing. Reports may include defect reports, test execution reports, test summary reports, and any other relevant documentation. These reports provide valuable insights into the testing progress, identified issues, and overall test results.
